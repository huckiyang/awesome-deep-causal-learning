This collection is initiated in 2018.

### A curated list of awesome deep causal learning methods - when causaliy deep meets deep neural network. 

Inspired by [awesome-deep-vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision), [awesome-adversarial-machine-learning](https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning), [awesome-deep-learning-papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers), [awesome-architecture-search](https://github.com/markdtw/awesome-architecture-search), [awesome-deep-neuroevolution](https://github.com/Alro10/awesome-deep-neuroevolution) (nice idea for the code index) and [awesome-self-supervised-learning](https://github.com/jason718/awesome-self-supervised-learning).

Learning to inference and disentangle is the next big challenge of Deep Learning.

Welcome to commit and pull request. I will update some guideline on causal software, which could be found out [here](https://github.com/huckiyang/awesome-deep-causal-learning/blob/master/causal_learning_software.md).
